Implement a proxy REST API for obtaining information about a certain GitHub repo.

Requirements:
1.  Get repo details.
2.  Get a list of all pull requests.
3.  Get a list of all pull requests which have not been merged for two weeks or more.
4.  Get a list of all issues.
5.  Get a list of all forks.

Technology stack:
1.  Flask.
2.  The project code has to be available in your GitHub account.

Would be a benefit:
1.  Unit/Integration tests.
2.  Logging.
